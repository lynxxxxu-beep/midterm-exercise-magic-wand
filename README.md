# Cursor-Attraction magic wand playground

A small p5.js sketch that blends cursor-tracking, attraction forces, and lightweight physics into an interactive visual scene.

## Final Outcome

- A **star-shaped follower** trails the cursor with smooth, floating, sinusoidal motion.
- Several **balls and boxes** are attracted to the star, each with randomized force limits and noise to create varied, organic paths.
- Dragging the mouse produces a **magic-wand trail**, spawning polygon fragments that fall and collide like physical debris.
- Basic **matter.js integration** allows these fragments to interact with constraints and compound bodies, enabling early collision and rotation experiments.

The sketch acts as an experimental playground for motion, randomness, and physics-based interaction.
